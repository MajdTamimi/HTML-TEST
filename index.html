    <h2 style="color: darkgreen;">Introduction</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">
        The <i style="color: gray;">web</i> has transformed the way we communicate, learn, and work. 
        Since its invention, it has become an integral part of our daily lives, enabling access to a vast amount of 
        information and services. In this article, we will explore what the web is, its history, and its components.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: darkgreen;">What is the Web?</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        The web, often referred to as the <b style="color: red;">World Wide Web (WWW)</b>, is a system of interlinked hypertext documents 
        that are accessed via the internet. Users can navigate between different web pages through links, using a web 
        browser. Web pages are created using <i>HTML</i> (HyperText Markup Language), styled with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), 
        and made interactive using JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p style="background-color: yellow; padding: 10px;">
        <mark>Fun fact:</mark> The web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: darkgreen;">Key Components of the Web</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        The web consists of several major components:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b style="color: rgb(41, 102, 57);">Web Pages:</b> Documents that are displayed to users, written in HTML.</li>
        <li><b style="color: rgb(41, 102, 57);">Browsers:</b> Software such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox that display web pages to users.</li>
        <li><b style="color: rgb(41, 102, 57);">Servers:</b> Computers that store web pages and deliver them to users upon request.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color: darkgreen;">The Evolution of the Web</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        Since its inception, the web has undergone rapid development. Early web pages were simple text documents, 
        but today, the web is much more <small style="font-size: 12px; color: gray;">complex</small> and interactive. We can now stream videos, play 
        online games, and even conduct business through web applications.
    </p>
    <p style="text-decoration: line-through;">
        However, the web has not always been perfect. For example, certain technologies have become <del>obsolete</del>, 
        such as Adobe Flash, which was once widely used for animations and multimedia.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: darkgreen;">Future of the Web</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        The web continues to evolve, with new technologies emerging all the time. Concepts such as 
        <sub style="color: blue;">artificial intelligence (AI)</sub> and <sup style="color: blue;">virtual reality (VR)</sup> are expected to play a major role 
        in shaping the future of the web.
    </p>
    <p style="text-decoration: underline;">
        Additionally, advancements like the development of <u>5G networks</u> and faster broadband speeds will make the 
        web even more accessible and useful.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: darkgreen;">Conclusion</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        The web has revolutionized our world in countless ways, and its impact will only continue to grow. 
        From simple HTML pages to sophisticated web applications, the possibilities are endless. As the web evolves, 
        it will bring even more innovations that will change the way we interact with the digital world.
